Okay, so the main plan here is
to let the player choose whatever he want
I'm trying to make this game as real as I could
First, the player must choose his living place
Then, he must describe his living place
I'll make sure to make a lot of realistic choices
So, the background would be as real as it is
The main living choices are
City and Village
The city livehood would just busy as usual
Crowd places, living with family, and boring daily activities
But the player could give it another scene
If he picked different choices I've made
The player age can be different from the real one
Let's say, 30yo player would like to know
How 18yo person daily life look like
So, he could select his age to 18
And play the game throughoutly
I'll try my best to give him what he want to know
The village livehood would be more like as we know
The player could choose between outer city background
Or mountainous background, even beach village background
Outer city background would give his liveplace
as a gangstar life, dirty place, high crime, discrimination
Or he could pick a peaceful outer city village
Just like a classic fairy tale
