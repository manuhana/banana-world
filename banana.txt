Okay, so this is my new project
Currently, I'm trying to make a text-based interactive story
The main character would be the player
And the player may choose the ending based on their choices
Such a classic boring game, huh?
Poor me, I wrote the entire code myself
Too cliche isn't it? :)
Well, I'm still beginner after all
Making such a simple game like this does take a lot of effort
You may copy the source code and modify the whole things
Just, make sure to put the 'Banana World' magic words in your credit :)
If you enjoy the game or like to made projects with me
Feel free to contact me :)
Open source projects are always welcome after all
So, yeah, you can always ask me :)
Thank you for your visit
Have a good day!
Main branch here is City and Village, where village could be differ on Player Choices
