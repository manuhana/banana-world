Main game branch is City or Village neighborhood
City neighborhood would be busy as we know
Main Character (MC) homestay could be a family house or even either private rent house or room
If MC choose private rent house, then there will be another choice for being alone or with some roomates
The atmosphere could be different in each choices, to give MC more experiences
MC could be an employed person or unemployed
I've planned different daily activities on each branch
